<h1> Learning to code 4 </h1><br />
    Now I'm learning machine learning and artificial intelligence. I think that these are great skills to have in the programming world, as many companies and startups are turning to automation and AI solutions. I'm also studying Python for back-end development, to create web applications and sites. I have also looked into HTML and JavaScript for front-end development and user experiences. I'm also getting familiar with Flutter and Docker, which are great tools for mobile and application development, respectively. Finally, I'm studying the basics of Java, as it is still a major language used in many projects. <br />
<br />
I want to continue to develop my programming skills, in order to be able to find freelance work in the programming world. With my current skillset, I'm confident that I can develop web applications and sites, and even some mobile applications. I'm also looking forward to learning more advanced AI and machine learning techniques, as well as more advanced coding techniques in Java and Python. All in all, my goal is to become a successful programmer and find freelance work in the programming world.</body>
