<h1> Learning to code 11 </h1><br />
   <br />
    In my last blog post, I talked about my journey so far in learning to program. I have covered the basics in Python, JavaScript, HTML, Flutter, Docker, and the basics of Java. I’ve also created a few websites using Flask Python. <br />
<br />
Now, I’m ready to take my skills to the next level. I want to focus more on deep learning, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This will allow me to create more sophisticated and innovative applications and websites.<br />
<br />
I am going to start by researching the various tools and frameworks that are available. I need to understand which ones are best suited for my needs and which ones are the most popular. I also need to learn about the different programming languages and libraries that are used for deep learning and machine learning.<br />
<br />
I am also going to be doing some research into the different open source projects that are available. This will help me to understand how to integrate different technologies together. I want to be able to build applications that are both secure and reliable.<br />
<br />
In addition to the research, I am also going to be doing some coding. I want to be able to build up my skills and understanding of the different technologies so that I can create the best applications possible. I am also going to be looking into different freelance opportunities that I can take advantage of.<br />
<br />
Learning to program is an exciting journey and I am looking forward to the skills and knowledge I will gain as I continue. I am sure that I will have a lot of fun and success in the process. I just need to stay focused, work hard, and keep learning.</body>
