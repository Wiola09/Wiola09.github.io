<h1> Learning to code 8 </h1><br />
    I'm continuing with my studies in coding, and the goal is to become a professional freelancer in the field of programming. So far, I have learned Python, JavaScript, HTML, Flutter, Docker, and the basics of Java. I have also created several websites with the help of Flask Python. <br />
<br />
My next step is to learn more advanced concepts of coding, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. AI and machine learning are increasingly important in the world of programming, and having knowledge in this field will help me become a better and more successful programmer.<br />
<br />
To get started, I plan to learn the basics of AI and machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and deep learning. I also plan to explore various AI tools and libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and Keras.<br />
<br />
In addition to learning the basics, I plan to practice coding with AI and machine learning projects. This will help me learn different AI techniques, as well as how to apply them to solve real-world problems. It will also help me gain valuable experience in working with AI that I can use in my future projects.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm excited to continue learning coding and to pursue a career in programming. Learning AI and machine learning is an important step in this journey, and I'm determined to make the most of it.</body>
