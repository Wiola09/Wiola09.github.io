<h1> Learning to code </h1><br />
    Learning to code is one of the most important skills to acquire in today's world. With technology becoming an increasingly integral part of our lives, having the ability to code can open up a world of opportunities. <br />
<br />
I'm Miroslav, and I'm currently learning programming. I started out with Python and have since become acquainted with JavaScript, HTML, Flutter, Docker, SQL databases, and the basics of Java. I've created several websites with Flask Python and I'm continuing to learn more.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in learning more about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, as well as advancing my skills in web development and software engineering. Through my studies, I'm hoping to eventually turn freelance programming into a full-time career.<br />
<br />
I'm documenting my journey through my blog, which includes resources for those who are just starting out with coding, tips for more experienced coders, and reflections on my progress. I'm also exploring the concept of having a more flexible lifestyle by taking up remote work.<br />
<br />
By sharing my experiences and insights, I'm hoping to help others who are on the same path as myself. Learning to code can often seem intimidating, but with the right resources, it can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience.</body>
