<h1> Learning to code 7 </h1><br />
    When it comes to learning to code, I have been focusing on Python, JavaScript, HTML, and Flutter for the past few months. I have been able to create a few websites using the Flask Python framework. Additionally, I have learned the basics of Java and started to understand the basics of Docker and SQL databases. <br />
<br />
Now, I am looking to expand my knowledge further. I want to learn more about artificial intelligence and machine learning, as these skills are highly sought after in the tech industry. I plan to take courses in both areas, as well as explore some of the open source projects available. Additionally, I am interested in learning about web development and software engineering. <br />
<br />
I am also exploring other programming languages, such as C++ and Java. I am eager to learn about the different ways of programming and the best ways to design code. In the future, I am interested in working as a freelance programmer. Learning the different coding languages and technologies is an important first step in this journey.<br />
<br />
I am confident that with the knowledge I have gained and the commitment I have to learning, I will be able to get a job as a freelance programmer. I am excited to see what opportunities lie ahead.</body>
