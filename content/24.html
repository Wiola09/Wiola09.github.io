<h1> Learning to code 10 </h1><br />
    As I continue to learn more about coding, I'm finding myself more and more interested in the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). I'm starting to understand how these technologies can be used to solve problems and create new ways of doing things. I'm also exploring the various frameworks and libraries available to help with the development of AI and ML applications. <br />
<br />
I'm also learning more about Python, which is becoming increasingly popular for data science and machine learning. I'm learning the basics of the language, and exploring various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, which are essential for data analysis and data science. I'm also learning some of the fundamentals of machine learning, such as how to build and train models, and how to interpret the results.<br />
<br />
I'm also looking into other languages, such as Java and JavaScript, to build web-based applications. I'm learning how to use libraries and frameworks such as React and Express to create dynamic web applications. I'm also getting acquainted with database technologies such as MySQL and MongoDB.<br />
<br />
Finally, I'm exploring the world of containerization, using Docker to create small, isolated environments for running applications. This is becoming increasingly important for developing cloud-native applications.<br />
<br />
I'm excited to see what I can create with all this knowledge, and I'm looking forward to continuing to learn and develop my skills in programming and AI.</body>
