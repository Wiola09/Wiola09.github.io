<h1> Learning to code 3 </h1><br />
    As I continue to learn and practice programming, I have decided to focus on several areas that I think will help me land a successful freelance job. I want to continue to learn Python, as I feel it is the most versatile and useful language for coders. I also want to gain a better understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as these are becoming increasingly important in the tech industry. Additionally, I want to become more familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as these are essential for web development. Finally, I want to learn more about Java, as this is a popular language for many applications. <br />
<br />
By studying these topics and gaining experience in coding, I hope to become a better programmer and increase my chances of getting a freelance job in programming. I am looking forward to the challenge and I am excited to see what I can create.</body>
