<h1> Learning to code 5 </h1><br />
    I'm Miroslav, and I'm learning to code. I already have a good grasp of Python, JavaScript, HTML, Flutter, Docker, and basic Java. I've also created a few websites with Flask Python. But I want to keep learning and expanding my skillset. <br />
<br />
So what should I be looking into next? Well, I think Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are really interesting topics. They offer a great deal of potential, and could be very lucrative areas to get involved in. As far as languages go, Python is the most popular for both AI and ML, so I'll definitely focus on learning more of it. <br />
<br />
I'm also considering brushing up on my web development skills. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all important, and I'd like to be comfortable with them before I start taking on more complex projects. I'm also going to look into React.js, as well as Node.js and Express.js. These technologies can be used to create powerful web applications, so it's important for me to learn them.<br />
<br />
Finally, I'm going to start doing some freelance work. I'm confident in my abilities and feel that I'm ready to take on real-world projects. This will give me the opportunity to put my skills to the test and build up my portfolio.<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm excited to continue learning and developing my coding skills. There's a lot of potential in the world of programming, and I'm looking forward to making the most of it.</body>
