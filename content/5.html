<h1> use of lambda function  </h1><br />
    Python is a powerful programming language that can be used to create a variety of applications. One of the most useful features of Python is the “lambda” function, which is used to create anonymous functions. With this function, you can quickly and easily define functions without having to create a named function. <br />
<br />
The lambda function is particularly useful for machine learning tasks, as it allows you to quickly and easily create functions that can be used to train and test models. The lambda function is also useful when creating AI applications, as it can be used to quickly create functions that can be used to process data and create predictions. <br />
<br />
Overall, the lambda function is a powerful and useful tool that can be used to quickly and easily create functions without having to name them. This makes it a great tool for machine learning applications and AI projects.</body>
