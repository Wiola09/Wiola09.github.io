<h1> Learning to code 9 </h1><br />
    In this blog, I would like to discuss the next steps in my learning journey, in order to become a freelance programmer. I have already learned a lot about Python, HTML, JavaScript, and Flutter. I am particularly interested in learning more about artificial intelligence and machine learning. <br />
<br />
I know that these areas of programming require a lot of mathematical knowledge, so I plan to take some classes and read some books to brush up on my math skills. I also plan to learn more about data structures and algorithms, as well as how to use APIs and build projects. <br />
<br />
I am also interested in creating web applications with the Flask Framework. I would like to learn how to use Docker to deploy web applications and create databases with SQL. I will also be looking into different web hosting services, such as AWS and Heroku, to find the best solution for deploying my projects. <br />
<br />
Finally, I want to learn more about Java and the Android SDK to create mobile apps. I plan to look into libraries, such as React Native and Ionic, to build hybrid apps. This will enable me to create projects for both Android and iOS. <br />
<br />
The journey of learning to code is always ongoing, and I am very excited to continue my journey.  I am looking forward to the challenges and the opportunities that coding and programming will give me.</body>
