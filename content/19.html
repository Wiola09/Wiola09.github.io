<h1> Learning to code 6 </h1><br />
    Learning to code can be challenging but also very rewarding. In the past six months, I have been learning python, JavaScript, HTML, Flutter, Docker, and basics of Java. I have created several websites with Flask and have been exploring machine learning and AI applications.<br />
<br />
I am now looking to further my skills in order to land a job as a freelance programmer. I want to focus my studies on databases, such as MySQL and SQLite, and expand my knowledge in the area of web development, such as React and Node.js. I am also looking to learn more about artificial intelligence and machine learning and apply them to create useful applications and websites.<br />
<br />
In addition to the technical aspects of coding, I am also looking to improve my problem-solving and debugging skills. This will be essential in order to be able to identify and solve programming problems quickly and effectively.<br />
<br />
I am excited to see what I can accomplish as I continue to learn and develop my programming skills. With hard work and dedication, I am confident that I can make my dream of becoming a freelance programmer a reality.</body>
