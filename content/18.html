<h1> Learning to code 6 </h1><br />
    Learning to code is a process that requires a lot of dedication and dedication, and I'm no exception. After having a good knowledge of Python, I decided to move further and learn other technologies. <br />
<br />
Currently, I'm learning JavaScript, HTML, Flutter, Docker, and SQL databases. I have also started to learn the basics of Java. I have created a few sites with Flask Python, and I'm also learning about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.<br />
<br />
To become a freelance programmer, I need to develop my skills in all these domains. This is a challenge, but it's also a great opportunity to learn more and become a better programmer. I'm also trying to understand the concepts and principles of software engineering, in order to be able to create better software applications.<br />
<br />
In the near future, I plan to develop my skills in web development, mobile development, and artificial intelligence. I'm also looking forward to developing projects and creating applications with the help of all the technologies I'm learning.<br />
<br />
Learning to code is a never-ending process, and I'm always trying to stay up to date with the newest technologies and trends. I'm constantly pushing myself to learn and develop my skills, so I can reach my goals and have a successful career in programming.</body>
