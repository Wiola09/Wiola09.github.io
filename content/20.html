<h1> Learning to code 6 </h1><br />
    Technology and programming are constantly evolving, so it's important to stay up to date with the latest trends and techniques. As a self-taught programmer, I'm always looking for ways to learn more and stay ahead of the curve. This blog post is about the skills and technologies I want to learn in order to be able to get a freelance job in programming.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, I want to become more proficient in Python. I already have the basics down, but I want to learn more advanced concepts and be able to use more libraries and frameworks like Flask, Django, and TensorFlow. I also want to learn more about AI and machine learning, and use Python to create applications that can automate tasks and make decisions.<br />
<br />
I also want to get better at JavaScript and HTML, so I can create interactive websites and web applications. I want to learn more about the different frameworks and libraries, and be able to use them in my projects.<br />
<br />
In addition, I want to learn more about mobile development and create apps for Android and iOS with Flutter. I’m also interested in learning about Docker, which is a great tool for creating and deploying applications.<br />
<br />
Finally, I want to learn more about databases, and be able to create and manipulate data in SQL databases. This is an important skill for any programmer, and will help me in my projects.<br />
<br />
I'm excited to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in programming. With the right skills and dedication, I'm confident I can get a freelance job in programming in the near future.</body>
